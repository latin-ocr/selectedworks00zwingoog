not be omitted, ι part thet they might not coniuae baptism, it
appears thet they were ιο leae anxious ior their children than ιιι
themselves, especially since in the beginning their intanta had
⁹ been circumcised. it cannot be then thetii the apostlea nere
unwilling to baptizo the children there would not have arinen

disturbance. So because ol believera' opinione children were
baptired, ιιι ior thia reason there ιι no distinct mention oi it.
But ιι they admit that parente erere anxious about the baptiam οι
their children, then they conquered ιιι baptizcd them, ιοι bap·
tium oonquered and remained when circumcirion became anti·
quareo For ιι consideration, etrite ιιι anxiety did ariae, and
yet the opinion ol thore who thought they ought to be haptiaed
