them, but nov since there is nothing bitterer or ruore harah
· [than they], it becomes evident that gentleneas ia uughr by them
justas ve have heard that temperance vas taught once by a

most eager glutton. For arhen any edible vas brought in d
which he vas particularly lond, he used to rrarn hir table-corn·
paniona not to avallovr it hurriedly arrd hasflly. but quietly to
dvell upon it and to masticate it for a long time, and ao increase
‚the pleasure by lengthening it, in order that he might gorge hirn-
sell the more abundantly. So since there ia nothing haraher
than these (lor vhat age has ever seen such evil speakingl)
they reter others to Christ to leam gentleness, vhile they them· ’
selues go as lar lrom hia example as possible. 'lhen they adduce
the example oi Christ vhen he dealt trith the noman adulterer,
y. e.. he did not hand her over to be stoned, but regarded her
with compassion, and said: Go and sin no more. Indeed they
write all this charmingly, so that you may the more easily· under·
stand that those spirits are even nov propitious to adulteren.
But look here, you slothtul and over-sensitive fellone, have yon
not read that Christ gave all sorta ol precedente in accordance
with the diversity ol occasions? Horr often do you read the
'most cruel things? Here then leam to recognize a divine and
punishing justice. How often, on the contrary, do you read the
most gentle? There recognize pity. 'lhen in arrord leam this,
·that he whose first coming had nothing harah in it, vith that
same one there is also the most complete iustice, but since in
that first coming his purpose was not to judge or condemn, bot
to saver he preserved the limita ol hia mission. Unless you show
me that somewhere during that advent he assumed the authority
ol a judge, you will never move me by that example [to believe]
that the magistracy is not lavrlul lor a Christian. Thia you
cannot do, lor he ssed when once they wished to make him king.
Eut nov that that mirsion has been completed, and he lus eat
dovn at the right hand ol God, see whether or not he bas cle-⁸
rtroyed ctuel morderem and giren his vineyard to other vorhera.
