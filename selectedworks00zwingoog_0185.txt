enioy leisure so as to do nothing, then they eat in common. So
nith nives, not to do away rrith the Republr'c oi Pirum· they make
common not their orrn, but others 'l'his is proved by thetol-
loning: One oi their leaders lived in arillsge about dre miles ’
out oi the city,† a man oi considerable neslth Hir rriie came to
him in haste when he nas going away that he might leave nme
thing ior the children. She arked blood irom a stone. Mesu-

' nhile the nile remained ior the night, perhaps hoping that her
blandishments would rrin something irom him, and when tlte
hour arrived rhe sought the couch ol her husband, and the spirit·
ual man replied to her: Did 1 not tell you that you cerne onlylor
lust? He theu caat her off, and called to him a Catabapt'ut girl
When the nile, ioreboding evil, opposed this, he devoted her to
evil. “ Yon are carnal,” he said, ‘⁸ and so you think and suspect
carnal things. You vill be damned eternally.” Since her ms·
picion rras in no vray shaken hythe maledictione, she ωηο to us
and told us what her husband, elsenise so impatient or lust, ’
imposed upon them to believe-i. e., about spiritual marriage„
For there war room ior the suspicion, since he had gone rritlr the· -
same girl on several occasions to St. Gall, and alone nith her had
passed not only through groves and shady places, but hnd ocem·
pied her couch during the night. Now finally he disclosed the
mystery-there uas a spiritual marriage between them-to rrhicln
statement the nile gave no credence. So this lellorr rrould hare
leit his uile common to others that he might leave something
common (he never touched her afterwards), unless she hed kept
her marriage rous nith better iaith than he, end took a common
girl, or rather, made her common.
