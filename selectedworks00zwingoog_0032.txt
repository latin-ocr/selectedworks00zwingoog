request oi the president and the nnvorthiness oi their course,
they went beck ιο their scats 'lbereupon 1 began ιο speak in
delente oi the tecchings oi Christ to the best oi my ability, and
mede enswer to their main heads in about this leshion:
- r. My iord suffragan has stated thar certain persons were
tecching seditione and obnoxious doctrines, bnt 1 οιοοοι be per·
snsded that he means this to be taken oi me, who lor nearly lonr
γεω noy hare been preaching the ¹gospel oi Christ and the
reachings ol the Apostles with so much energy. And yet it
nrors ”mahat ol this, inasmnch as he made the statement
heiore the Senate. For what concern were it oi mineii such
oeachings vere preached elsewhere, provided they were not
pseeched ιι anich? Tberelore, since it is not likely that the,
deson spoke oi the allairs oi ontsiders, it is clear that his ἶ
remarks rrere simed at me. Horrcrer much they disgnise it, it
is erident that here is the David ιο whom this Nathan imputed
the wrong. Bnt as to the gospel, it is no wonder that in one
phce or encther there shonld be differences between those who
cling doggedly ιο inhiare, thet is, human prescriptione, and
those who are uniriendly to the same. For Christ prophesied ’
most clearly that this rronld come ιο pass, saying: ⁴⁴1 came
not ιο send peace on earth, but ι ssord. For 1 am come ιο set
ι mn ιι vadense against his iether, and the daughter agninst
her mother, end the daughter-iniere against her mother-inho,
end it shall corne topessderaman'sioesshallbe theyoi his
orm honsehoid” Yet there eas no need oi this answer either.
lior anich more then any other oi the Seiss cantone is in peace
end quiet. end this eli good citizens pot doen ιο the credit oi
ι. Ae ιο the reproech, in the next place, ther ir is taught that
ιο hnnrrn prescriptione nor ceremoniale ought ιο be kept, 1 viil
