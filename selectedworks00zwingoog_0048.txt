· he did not want thir thing laid up ngainrt ur, and ro leit it iree.
'l'hereiore our roulr which had been nigh unto despair were¹
mightily reirerhed when we learned thore who were unable ιο
receive the rrying were threatened with no punishment by him
who cun rend both, body rud roul into hell But the latherr
nemen ιο hawe cart an anxionr eye in thir direction too, when
they rhowed themselves unwilling to enioin chartity upon ull
without exception or ιο require r wow oi chartity lrom otherr-
the priertr, ιι leart, and ewen rhlelded human weelnere with
elever wordr, er wru proper, iu thir wryr-When the rponror
who wer aocnrtomed to make anrwer lor all who were to he con·
firmed wer rrked, “Are they righteour, there whom you prerent?”
‘he war wont ιο rnrwerr “lhey are righteour'¹ ullre they
well treinedl” “They rte well trained,” etc. When, however,
they came ιο chartity-“Are they charte”'‚he anrwered, “Ar lar
er human lrailty ellowr” Thur ir appears that neither our
predecerrorr nor the iatherr in our own day wanted that bound
hnrd and lert which Christ had rudered to he free, lert they
might ear the rweet yoke ol the iord with bitter wormwood. ’
Hawing, 1 rry, thur balanced there considerationr, to wit, thet
we ere held ιο the maintennnce ol chartity by neither divine nor
humen lew, we considered neverthelerr that though chartity go
hee, yet animal purrion ought not to roam promiscuourly, but to
be bounded by rrrle rnd montaney, and lorced into reasonable
limitr, like the rertol the courre oi our lile, which though lree -
becomer wildnerr and centurion, unlerr it be rert'raincd by -
moderatiori, that we rinlr not to the level ol rwine. And thir we
ree the Mnker ol all thingr willed lrom the beginning ol creation,
when he lrrhioned ior Adam lrom hir rib one woman only er a
helpmeet and not ι gmup or crowd ol women, and joined her
prerently by ro lirm a bond that a man lenver iather and mother
