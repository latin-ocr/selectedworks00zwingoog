the following example: At S. Gall there ιιι ι Catabaptist girl oi .
about ιι yeam or ι little more. She ιιι ιιι daughter oi ι right
thinking man, ιι they say. He ιιι prepsring one day to osny
some provisions (he is ι providet oi grain) ιιιι his magns«
ιιιιιι him to remain ιι home, ior he ιοιιι ιιι ιοιιιιιιιι
wonderful. Α little aiter ιιι ιιι down in the say 1 ιιιιιιιιι

above. And ιιιι ιιι ιιι making up she ιιιιιιι out those y

empty rarings oi theirs llou ιιι how she ιιιι ιιιι ιιι ιιι
going to ιιι. Why did she not lali ιοιι- ιι οιιι when ιιι ιιι
. ιιι father leaving? Why,shehadnotbeen taughtall she should
say ιιιι coming to consciousness, nor been told oi ιι ιιιι
there ιιι ιιιι oi in accomplishing ιιι affair. Every ισι ιιι
then they use these tricks still ιι Αιιιιι. And theyosll ιιιι
attestation, though it applies to things past and lutose, so ιιιι
those vain seducere oi old ιοιιιι ιιιιοι say that ιιιι any one
testiiies, it is oi the present. Oh, ιιι sneetly ιιι gently do
they arrange everything. lle gods ιιι goddesses abone, ιιιοι
ιιι ιι between, be propitious to them! ·

(8) 'Ihey rightly tell us that Christ taught that our speech
'should be ever yea or nay, yet they do not seem clearly to under·
ιιιιι it, orii they understand they do not ιιι upon it. For
though in many places they have said yea, it ιιι never been
yea. When those leaders are banished against ιιοιι 1 irrite
especially, and are asked toran esth, they vill not take οιιι. ιιι
say that through the iaith which they have in God they ιιοι
they ιιιι never return. ιιι yet having been seen returned ,they say
the Father led ιιι haelr through his ιιι. 1 ιιοι very ιιι ιιιι
itis the iather oi lies that brings them back, they pretend tn

know ιι is the heavenly Father. This rs ιοιιι telling: When '

that George (ιιοιι they ιιι calla second Paul) oi the horne (ι
Jacob [Blaurock] ιιι cudgeled ιίιι rods among ns esen to the
infernal gnte, ιιι ιιι ιιιιι by the senate's offieer to take οιιι
ιιι lits his hands [in affirmation1. ιι first he refused, ιι ιι ιιι ·
