the Scriptores, and not they, eere' the judger. The Scripturer
are ao much the nme everywhere, the Spirit ol God llowa ro ,

meana ol the Scripturer, taught by the Spirit ol God, until he

attaina tbe truth. For Chriat whenerer he argued nith the

learned Jever and Phariaene relerred to the Scripturer, raying:

“Searcb the Scripturea” John v. 39. Alro, “What ia written

in the larr.”· Lukex. 2⁶, etc. Therelore I ray the matter neede

no human judge. But that at various timer ruch matters gener·

the reason that tbe priertu no longerderired to atudy, and pald*
greater attention to emtonnem, at timer to chere, than reading ··
