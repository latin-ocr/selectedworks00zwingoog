. 'lhereiore as iar ‘aa concems this mandate 1 do not desire to
· epesi further. But since the good, pious gentleman (Ι don't
huon vehere he aits, because 1 cannot see him.) has referred
to the priest imprisoned at constance my office requires me to

· make answer. Yon all know, dear sire, horr this priest nas turned
orer to my gracious [ord oi Constance by the common peers
[lit. conlederates: citizens ol the Coniederacy] in the diet at
Badeo as ι guilty man. Accordingly my gracims lord bad the
prisoner examined and questioned by appointees oi his Grace‚
and the prisoner ιιιι iound to be an ignorant and erring man in
the divine Scriptures, and l myseli have olterr pitied his unskilliul
remarks. For bymy iaitb 1 can say that 1 questioned him
myreli, went ιο him in Christian love, set iorth ιο him some oi
the Scriptores irom St Paul, and he made—what shall l say?—

· very inaccurate snsners. Ah, my dearsirs, vehat shall 1 say about
this good, simple lellorr? He is really untutored‚ and is not
even a grammarian* For in Christian brotherly love, kindly and
without any, anger, 1 mentioned to him some Scriptures,·aa ior
instance, that the noble Paul exhorted Timothy‚ saying: Pietas
ad omnia utilis (kindness and greatness are good in all' things),
end hie answer nas so childish and unchristian as to be improper
to mention and report in the Coniederation. But that you may
really huon, my dear sirs, 1 spolre nith him about praying to the
dear rainu and to the mother oi God, also about their intercession,
and 1 iound him so ignorant and unchristian on these points
that 1 pity his error. lle insiste on making living out oi the
dead, although the Scriptures show that also beiorethe birth oi
Christ the dear saints nere prayed to and called upon ior others,
aa 1 finally convinced and persuaded him by means ol Scriptures,
that is, by Genesis, Exodus, Ezechiel and Bamch. lalso brought
matters ιο iar that be recanted bis error, and desires to recant
all his errors about the mother ol God and the dear saints. 1
ebo hope that berrill he grateiul to me and soonhe releesed.

’'lhat la not ι hunus.
