. time ni the hnly pope Gregory (11.) it has continued in use
among all Christianity, it seems strange to me that noir ior the
hrst time people desire ιο oonsider this wrong and erroneous,
candary to Christian ordinance, although there are len men srho
do not ieel the aid oi the mother ni God and the dear saints,
not alone among us christiam, hut also among some unheliesing ·
heathen. livre here at Zttrich srenou to speair and light against
such customs common ιο all the world, and especially those pre·
sesred so long by Christians, let each one think lor himseli horr
that would please those in the Orient, the Occiderit, irum sunrise

· ιο mnset, also those in Hibernia, Mauritania, Syria, Cappadocia
or in the Cyclades. 1 do not need to mention nountries nearer
urar lands. Truly, dear sira, it would be srell ιο consider heiore·
hand what dangers and dissensions might arise ior Christianity ii
one nere not in harmony and agreement srith the whole com·
munity in these matters. For you see, as slso a heathen called
Sallust in ‘⁴ Jugurtha '’ testifies, that small things arise irum unity,
hut irom dissensiou great things decresse and iall away. ‘ihere-
lore my advice would he, not ιο consider anythingoi these affairs
shich pertain ιο the whole Church, hut to save them lor a
general οοοοοιΊ. And although Master Ulrich reiers ιο Bibles
in llehretr, Latin and Greek, and therehy consoles himseli, which
Scripture also those here present being taught sufficiently stell in
the three langusges should examine, and such scripture as ls
pertinent to the case they should judge and consider, still 1 say,
hs the first place, that is not a small giit oi God ιο (he ahle ιο)
expound the shore-mentioned lsngusges, and 1 do not boast that
1 possess it. Forthese are especiul giits oi God,asalsoPaul
says to the Corinthians (all. r-ro): Unique datur manifestatio
spiritns ad utilitatem, toeach is pseu the nanuesution oi ths
spirit ior use, to the one isith, to the other eloquence, ιο this ons
the interpretation oi langusges, etc. Ol these graees nr gilts 1
οιοοοι hosst oi poneming any, as 1 house nothing oi Hehresr,
sm not stell taught in Greek, and understand latin only tolershly.
