Midou·

When my Sir Vicsr speaks end quotes irorn the Gospei, ⁶⁸ He
thst is not against ns is ior us,” 1 say thet is true. “Now the
customs end ordinances oi the Chnrch ere ordered end decreed
hy men, not egsinst God,” etc. Sir Vicsr, prove thet. For
Christ eineys despises humen ordinsnce end decree, es we heve

' in Mett. xv. 1-9. When the Jews nod Pherisees blamed and
stucted the lond because his disciples did not obey the doc·
trine end ordinsnce oi the ancienn Christ said to them: “Why
do ye eleo transgress the commandment oi God hy your trudi-a·
tion?” etc. And the Iord spoke further: “Ye hypocriten, veli
did Essiss prophesy oi you, using, This people dnneth nigh
ento me trith their mouth and knoneth nne nith their lips, htrt
their hesrt is ier irom nte. But in rein do they worship me,
taching ior doctrines the commendments oi men.” One sees
here that God does not desire our decree and 'doctrine when
they do not originnte trith Him, despises them, end says rre¹
serve Him in vain, which niso St. Perti shows to ns when he
irrites thos: Denr brethren, iet no tneo begnile you by humen
nrisdom end deceit, in scoordsnce trith the doctrine or decree
ot men, in necordsnce trith the doctrines oi this world, end not
those oi Christ. “Let no rnen thereiore judge you in ment, or
in drink. or in respect oi a bolides, oroi s new moon, oroi the
thhsth days Which nre s rhodon oi things to come‚” etc.
Coi. ii. 1⁶ ff. God nante from ns His decree, His vriil sione,
not our opinion. God the Iord cares rnore ior obedience to '
His word (although they nse the word ‘⁸ obedience '' ior humen
obedience) then ior att our sacrifices end seli-crented church
unges, ss we here it in sti the divine neritings oi the prophete,
