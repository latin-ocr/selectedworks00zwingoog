prophetesses among the Gentiles, that we might recognize the
liberty ‚oi his vill and the authority oi his election! Bnt theirs
ore tlte fathers also, men filled with cod, nme oi arbom, though
almost the whole rrorld yse living a bestial lile (ior where Gadis .
not worshiped what diderence is there between man and beasti) .
aud was following its oyu raglng affections, alone honored God,
believed his word and submitted themselves to his vill. others
boldlyannounced the good things which through the in·bresthing

were his people and were oi his church. And when, iu giving · '

command or prohibition, he addresses that whole people, tlte in·
iants are not excluded because they understand nothing ot what
is aaid or commanded, but he speaks synecdochically, so that eo
