‘lhe thing itaeli compels me ssilly nilly, good reader, to ceasc
to give the sain words oi the Catahaptists and to drasr to ‚⁸ close.
So heseaiter 1 will act thuss 1 ssill untie every huot, and what·
eser is said by them that has any iorce 1 will adduce with such
fidelity as 1 have thus iar in rendering it literally into Latin. And
lor this meson in particular, that what they have thus lar adduced
against the figurative sense has been in great past reluted. What
they have argued about the Testament will be ao treated and .
torn away sshen ne reach the Testament

The arguments against the synecdoche in r Cor. x. 9: All our
lathem were under the cloud, they all crossed the sea, all'ysere
baptised unto Moses, all ate the sante spiritual lond-the argn-
menta, 1 say, that they berk out against these synecdoches are eo “
loolidr and impure that they are not to be taken into account· ' '
For they say they know that they ate, drank, crossed the sea,
ssent to stool and urinated, but it must heproved by us by clear

· Scripture that iniants ssere baptized. Aiter that they insult us
thir isay: See nov hon Zssingli stands ssith his synecdoche, sshich
he affirma ssith his own peculiar cunning and sophistry, lest by

apostles' time believers' iniants ssere baptized, as Ι have indicated

above. They approach the matter with bitterness, since they '
can do nothing hy the sharp energy oi the sord oi God. 'lhey
