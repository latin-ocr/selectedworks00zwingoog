But it says in the nme plnee that the spostles bapuzed. For sss
should at once reply: onir the apostles rightly hnptised, esen ·
though Christ himsell did not, sse, too, rightly baptise inbuta,
though the apostles did not. There is no differente in the
cases, or rather our case is the strungery se hare Chrr‘st's not
