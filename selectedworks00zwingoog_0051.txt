-i some extent who have forbidden marriage ne refrain from saying

nov, thinking it enough that the fire of passion alone (aud that

., so frequent and violent as to threaten the mind) isprooouuced

Ἴ sufficient reason for marriage. The fourth passage is verse ις iu

·’ thesaure chapter: ⁸⁴ Norr concerning virgins 1 have no oum·

maranen or ne rnre: ret 1 gne myrensem? ’ω M·

ἰ ; the teacher of the natione, the chonen instrument of God, seith
.' whom Christ had spoken intimately from heaven more then
··'- once, says that he has no commandment of the Iord in regard to

Ι virginity, and has an unpurified man such commandmenti ’
’ Then too Paul had said much of the salue of uirginity aud its ,⁴

’· advantages, and much of the trials and unhappiness of marriage,

j and he added, verse 35, ‘⁸ And thir 1 speak for your own prosit,
“ ιοι that 1 may cast a marsupon you,’' wishing, though henan
f greatly praised the state of virginity, not to seem of opinion that
it ought to be commanded. The fifth passage is ι Timothy tii.
r, foll: “This is a true saying, lfa man desire the office of ι

-ζ bishop, he desirethagoodwork„ Α bishop then must be hiarne-

less, the husband of one wife,” etc. And alittle later he adds'

“having his children in subjection with all gravity.” Here ιιι

he bids a bishop have a wife, urhetlrer one only or une at a time

. we will not now discuss We noted also that the name bishop ·

1 is the name of an office, not oue of arrogant pride, and ueretore
·· we had no lear to call ourselves also bishops, that is, watchers,
because the other terms which are iu common use today either
, seem over-ambitious or are foreign words. With the ιιιιιιι of
' watcher, however, horr can any one be pufled up? Cau he ·
think it a state of high dignity and not a position of duty when
