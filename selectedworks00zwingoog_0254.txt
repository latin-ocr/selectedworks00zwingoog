He ss„ therefore, Rom. viii. οδε We know that all things work <
together for good to them that love God. Noe lest you should
say: Who therefore love God, or to whom are all things for

A good? he anticipstes and replies: To those who according to
purpose are of tue called. Do not understand this of shuman
purpose, hut of God’s, so that the sense is: Who are·ssnetified ¹
ol God’s purpose, for fo be caueri· here for to be only sancirfied.

by which God is girded for electing, as in lx. rr sse see when he
says: That the purpose of God according to election may stend-
His purpose is therefore above electior, ε’. e., first‘by nature. It
may happen among men that something is elected, but there is a
‘resson for its election‚ e. g„ it is elected because it seems useful
or right ‘l'nis purpose or deliberation isnot free, hut depende
on that which is elected. Since Paul wishes to show that God's
electionis born of his free purpose, sud not from those whom he
isebout to elect, he says that the free purpose is the csuse why
ell things work for good to those eho love God. Nothing is
esenhed to man’s ruerit. For he sdds: For whom he foreknev
(pronunciavit) he also predestinated to be conformed to the
image of his Son, etc. 1 heve translated προέγνω by “ pronun,

ing: I said that sllwill result ln good for those who according to
God’s purpose are of the called. This 1 would heve understood
thus: God freely with himself settles upon, prejudges and fore-
ordains (for by thia nord the nord for “purposing” is ex·
poonded) whom he vill, eren before they are horn. Whom he ,
